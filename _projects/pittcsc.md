excerpt: "The Pitt Computer Science Club is an initiative that I started at the
University of Pittsburgh in July of 2014 as a way for students to teach and
learn from each other through collaborating on projects, presenting fun,
interactive workshops and fostering networking both among students and with the
larger Pittsburgh technological community."
