# {{ page.title }}

Over the course of the last 4 months, I've transitioned from using Atom as my
every-day development tool to becoming a pretty hard-core fan of
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/). While the learning curve is steep at the beginning,
the ability to customize every aspect of the editor and the amazing plugin
community are the things that really drew me in.  However, the real deal
breaking for me was using it in conjunction with [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/),
allowing me to keep every
part of my development flow contained within one application ([iTerm
2](http://iterm2.com/)).  This post will largely go over how I have everything
set up and why I think Vim and Tmux make for the best possible development
workflow.
