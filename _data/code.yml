- title: Conway's Game of Life
  description: >
    After attending the Global Coderetreat Weekend in 2014, I became really
    interested in the Conway's Game of Life algorithm and wanted to finish an
    implementation of it.  I had never worked with React.js before, so I decided
    that it would be a good change to get my hands dirty with a new JS framework,
    too.  It's still a work in progress, but I'm trying to do some interesting
    things with it like make the board automatically fill the screen and allow
    the visitor to manually toggle the dead/alive state of any of the cells.
